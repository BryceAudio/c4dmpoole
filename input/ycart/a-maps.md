Presentation
</h3>

<p>
The MAPS dataset is the most used benchmark dataset for automatic music transcription (AMT).
We propose here an updated version of the ground truth MIDI files, containing, on top of the original pitch, onset and offsets,
additional annotations including precise beat, time signature, key signature annotations.
