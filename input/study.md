**UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM): 12 fully-funded PhD studentships to start September 2019**<br>

The Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London is a world-leading research group in the field of Music & Audio Technology. Our research covers everything in digital music and audio: from analysis, understanding and retrieval to delivery, synthesis and sound rendering. We seek not only to investigate new applications of digital signal processing (DSP), but also to push forward the frontiers of DSP itself.

Please see our list of [completed PhD theses in C4DM](phds.html) and our list of [current members of C4DM](people.html) for the wide range of topics we study.

PhD researchers are currently sought in a range of topics under any of our [research themes](index.html). Possible topic areas might include: automatic music transcription; harmony analysis; auditory scene analysis; beat tracking & rhythm analysis; blind source separation & independent component analysis (ICA); joint audio/video tracking and transcription; A/D & D/A conversion; sigma delta modulation; scalable audio codecs; object based coding; sparse representations & sparse coding; music information retrieval; semantic markup, musical metadata ; audio effects; 3D sound & multi-loudspeaker rendering systems; intelligent microphone arrays; automatic accompaniment; interactive performance/internet jamming; interactive compositional tools; biologically inspired audio processing; and pervasive audio ("my music wherever I am"). We have invested more than Â£6M in new state-of-the-art studios and computing facilities.

Funding
-------

The Centre for Digital Music hosts the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM), which will offer 12+ fully funded PhD studentships for September 2019. Applicants should follow the guidelines that can be found at: [https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/)

In addition, the Centre for Digital Music is part of the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, which has a number of fully-funded PhD Studentships that cover fees and maintenance for UK, EU, and international students. There is always strong competition for PhD Studentships, so early application is recommended. Applications are also welcomed from self-funded students. Applicants should follow the guidelines that can be found at [http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/phd/how-to-apply](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/phd/how-to-apply)
